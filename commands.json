First, custom power cabling will be likely since the main power input needs to run farther to reach the AC-DC unit, and the 24-pin and 8-pin power need to run further to reach the motherboard. Second, the original version (not marked with a version number) of the AC-DC unit is too thick to fit flush along the front of the chassis.
